# showsTracker
## This project utilizes an SQL script to make a database of 10 users and 10 shows as well as there relation to each other. 
## For this project we used a DAO and JDBC to connect to the database. 
## From there, we implemented a menu that requires a log in for a user. 
### use the username: nick123
### use the passwork: blue
## From the menu, the user should be able to get information on the shows they are watching and edit it at their own discretion. 
## The menu will also allow the creation of new accounts with a username check and password strength check.
